About Me
------

Hello there!

I am a PhD Fellow at the University of Copenhagen, supervised by Samir Bhatt and David DuchÃªne at the [Computational and Mathematical Public Health group](https://publichealth.ku.dk/about-the-department/section-epidemiology/research-epi/#collapse-1686303579196).

I am generally interested in speech and audio processing, computational biology, and applied machine learning for biological problems (e.g., neuroscience, genetics, epidemiology).

I have created and maintained several open-source projects, including [SERAB](https://github.com/Neclow/SERAB) and [Phylo2Vec](https://github.com/sbhattlab/phylo2vec).
