Hello everyone!

My name is Neil, I am a PhD student at the [Section of Epidemiology]((https://publichealth.ku.dk/about-the-department/section-epidemiology/) of the University of Copenhagen.

I am generally interested in computional biology (neuroscience, epidemiology) and deep learning-based representations of speech and audio. Throughout my Master studies at EPFL, I had the opportunity to work on several projects involving machine learning or data science with interdisciplinary applications in life sciences and engineering. I am also curious about ways to leverage insights from neuroscience to build robust and resilient artificial neural networks.
