About Me
------

Welcome!

I am a PhD Fellow at the University of Copenhagen, supervised by Samir Bhatt at the [Computational and Mathematical Public Health group](https://publichealth.ku.dk/about-the-department/section-epidemiology/research-epi/#collapse-1686303579196). I obtained my MSc in Life Sciences Engineering at EPFL, with a minor in computational neuroscience.

I am generally inerested in computational biology and applied machine learning for biological problems (e.g., neuroscience, genetics, epidemiology). I also had the opportunity to work on deep learning-based representations of speech and audio at Logitech.

Keywords: machine learning, computational biology, speech processing
