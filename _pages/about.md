Hello everyone!

My name is Neil, I am a research assistant at the [Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lgc/) at EPFL.

I am generally interested in computional biology (especially neuroscience) and deep learning-based representations of speech and audio. Throughout my Master studies at EPFL, I had the opportunity to work on several projects involving machine learning or data science with interdisciplinary applications in life sciences and engineering. I am also curious about ways to leverage insights from neuroscience to build robust and resilient artificial neural networks.

Education
